    "#### Proposal Requirements\n",
    "Your proposal should describe at a high level what you’re seeking to accomplish, and your motivation for performing this analysis. A guiding question or hypothesis to test is one good way to start. If you are going to work in a small group (encouraged!), you should also list your partners’ names. \n",
    "You should briefly describe your data sources; plan for doing the work, and up front concerns. If you are working in a group, please describe the roles and responsibilities of each group member. \n",
    "We’ll treat this proposal as a planning document, not a blue print containing “firm, fixed requirements.” \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final Project Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Project Your project should incorporate one or both of the two main themes of this course: network analysis and text processing. You need to show all of your work in a coherent workflow, and in a reproducible format, such as an IPython Notebook or an R Markdown document. If you are building a model or models, explain how you evaluate the “goodness” of the chosen model and parameters.\n"

In addition to the navigation paths, we provide the full HTML package of this version of Wikipedia, as well as all articles in plaintext.*\n",
